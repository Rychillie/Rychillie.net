Dedicated to improving skills by creating websites that stand out for their performance, accessibility and incredible designs.

I study the Swift language and also develop hybrid applications using React-Native and Expo. I constantly seek to expand my knowledge, exploring new technological and creative possibilities to offer innovative solutions to my projects.

Furthermore, I find pleasure in combining functionality and aesthetics, providing exceptional user experiences. I&apos;m always looking for the perfect balance between performance, affordability and visual beauty.
